# For Contributors

## TODO

- [ ] Ensure document comments are clear and accessible, even for beginners.
- [ ] Enhance the README with more detailed and specific examples.
- [ ] Refine the code in example/example.dart to better demonstrate use cases.
- [ ] Improve the existing tests in \_tests/.
- [ ] Revisit the ContextStore implementation. The current polling mechanism for checking if context is dismounted could be optimized.
- [ ] Currently, the tests primarily cover the ‘dispose’ functionality since the other operations are similar. However, consider extending the tests to include “cancel,” “close,” and “stop.”
- [ ] Think of ways we can make this package even easier to use.
- [ ] Consider adding linter rules to further strengthen the package’s capabilities.
